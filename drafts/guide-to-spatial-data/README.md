# A Programmer's Guide to Spatial Data

_How to work with maps and mapping data: a crash course for web developers and data scientists._


This resource will provide a competent developer or data scientist with little knowledge of spatial concepts an onramp to working with spatial data. 

The goal is to introduce concepts and the theory of spatial data capture, storage, analysis and visualisation in plain, coherent language. We will focus on communicating what programmers need to know to understand key concepts, and will link to more thorough resources whenever possible, if they're interested in going deeper.

The guide can be read from beginning to end, or used as a topic-specific reference. It is a living document, so if you have any suggestions, open an issue or fork and submit a pull request. 

Our hope is to make the complex world of spatial data a bit more comprehensible, so more people can experiment and innovate building location-based apps, web maps and spatial data analyses.
