# Chapter 2: Thinking Geo

_Part 2 of A Programmer's Guide to Spatial Data_

In [Part 1 of A Programmer's Guide to Spatial Data](./0-INTRODUCTION.md), we looked at how useful maps can be and introduced the concept of spatial data, which is any data that contains information about **where observations are**. We also introduced the two main ways of representing spatial data: a **raster dataset** is a regularly-spaced grid of cells or pixels with assigned values, and and **vector dataset** uses coordinate pairs or sequences of coordinate pairs to represent point, line and / or polygon features. 

Part 2 will dive deeper into the fundamental concepts that underpin location data, key ideas to understand to approach a spatial data analysis or visualisation task. We'll look at how some of the nuances of  coordinates and coordinate reference systems, projections, and we'll dig a bit deeper into raster and vector data. 

## Where Am I?

Accurately working out where we are on the Earth was one of the most difficult problems humans faced for millennia. Knowing where we are is the first step to deciding where we are going. For travellers - and especially mariners, who often had no fixed points of reference to orient themselves by other than the stars - the task of locating one's self was often a matter of life and death.

_[Dutch Boats in a Gale](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-dutch-boats-in-a-gale-the-bridgewater-sea-piece), by J.M.W. Turner, 1801, oil on canvas._

The Earth is round, but it is not a perfect sphere. It is a bit squashed - a shape called an "ellipsoid" - and it's lumpy, with mountains and valleys and sea mounts and so on, with different areas having different densities - more accurately, a "geoid". The planet rotates on its vertical axis. 

### Latitude

Imagine a line running through the diameter of a sphere along its vertical axis, connected by a line encircling the horizontal circumference of the sphere (called a meridian). From the center of the sphere - the midpoint of this diameter line - we can specify any _latitude_ - any position north or south of the equator on the sphere's surface. Latitude is represented as an angle, from 0¬∞ - a horizontal line out from the sphere's center point to the equator - to 90¬∞, a vertical line to the north or south pole.

As it turns out, latitude is _relatively_ easy to calculate by measuring the position of the sun at noon or the North Star or the Southern Cross above the horizon and doing some trigonometry, adjusting for the time of year. [ more here on calculating latitude? - or link to a video like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luwRQecuNpA ] 

### Longitude

Longitude, on the other hand, is quite a bit trickier. This is because there is no "East pole" or "West pole". Instead, we have decided to use one of the meridians as the origin, reference meridian - the "Prime meridian", running through Greenwich, UK and the outskirts of Accra, Ghana, dividing the Eastern and Western hemispheres. 

Again, longitude is described in degrees of the angle between the radius running from the Prime meridian to the center of the Earth and the radius to the position we're measuring. As we move east from 0¬∞, degrees increase up to 180¬∞, and as we move west from 0¬∞, degrees decrease to -180¬∞, until they meet at the antimeridian - the other boundary between the Eastern and Western hemispheres in the Pacific Ocean.

_Latitude and longitude, from [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/latitude#/media/1/331993/109269)._

Finding longitude requires the navigator to calculate the time difference between their position and a known position - often the Prime Meridian. As the Earth rotates 360¬∞ every 24 hours, by working out this time difference it is easy to compute how far east or west of the reference point someone is: 360¬∞ / 24 hrs = 15¬∞ per hour. It takes 4 minutes for the Earth to rotate 1¬∞.

Reliably keeping time on a moving ship is a tricky thing, explaining the long, interesting history of the quest to build an accurate clock. For more on the history of longitude and John Harrison's efforts to design this clock, we recommend [Longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)) by Dava Sobel.

With longitude and latitude - the `x` and `y` coordinates - we can describe any point on the Earth's surface. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è: Note how this differs from the linguistic convention - usually we refer to "latitude and longitude" when speaking, which breaks from the mathematical convention of ordering coordinates horizontal (x), then vertical (y). This is a constant bugbear for developers. There is no universally-agreed standard for ordering coordinates, so different programming tools / systems represent coordinates inconsistently - some as `[x,y]`, some as `[y,x]`. If your coordinates aren't showing up, or are in the wrong part of the world - first thing is to check the coordinate ordering! More on this [here](https://macwright.com/lonlat/), including which formats, JS APIs and services use which order, from Tom MacWright. 

### Representing coordinates

We've established that we can describe any position on the surface of a sphere as a pair of coordinates that represent the horizontal and vertical angles of a line transecting that position from the origin, which is a radius drawn to the intersection of the equator and the Prime Meridian. If you want more detail, see the [geographic coordinate systems article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system).

[ ^^ needs to be more clearly and concisely stated ]

As with any unit of measurement, there are several ways to represent coordinates. Historically, latitudes and longitudes were represented in **degrees, minutes, seconds**. 

‚ö†Ô∏è: Here, "minute" does not refer to a unit of time, but rather to a fraction of a degree. Referring to the angle measurements, 1¬∞ is divided into 60 minutes, represented as 60', and each minute is divided into 60 seconds, shown as 60". Coordinates are represented as `deg¬∞ min" sec' N||S, deg¬∞ min" sec' E||W` - Big Ben is located at 51¬∞30'02.6"N 0¬∞07'28.6"W.

This deg-min-sec format can be easy to understand in some contexts - but is not particularly easy for computers to work with. Instead, in most computing contexts coordinates are represented in decimal degrees - two float values. 

We can convert between the two formats - degrees minutes seconds and decimal degrees, based on the relationships we described above. In Python:

```python
degrees = 51
minutes = 30
seconds = 2.6
hemisphere = "N"

decimal_degrees = degrees + (minutes / 60) + (seconds / 3600)

if hemisphere == "S":
    decimal_degrees *= -1

print(decimal_degrees)
# 51.0007222222
```

Less frequently, you might find degrees measured in radians, which are angular units - [ concise definition of a radian ] - 1rad == 360 / 2pi == 57.2974693618 .

Converting from radians to decimal degrees - in JavaScript this time:

```javascript
var radians = 1.570797;
var decimalDegrees = radians * (360 / (Math.PI * 2));

console.log(decimalDegrees);
// 90.00003857181117
```

| Type | Example | 
| --- | --- |
| Decimal degrees | `[1.2314, 44.1243]` |
| Degrees, minutes, seconds | 1¬∞ xxx | 
| Radians | x |
| ?? | ?? |

## Fast forward to the 20th century

How GNSS systems work.

- Coordinate Reference Systems

### More complexity: coordinate reference systems

Earlier we talked about how the Earth is not a perfect sphere - it is actually an irregular ellipsoidal shape called a geoid. Not only is the physical shape of this volume irregular - it also has variation in the density of the materials that form it. The density of a material impacts its gravitational effect - depending on where you are on Earth, and what you're standing on, you're subjected to imperceptible variations in gravitation pull.

For someone walking around, these variations in the Earth's shape and local gravity don't make a significant impact. But if we are trying to create a system for accurately measuring points on the Earth's surface, they do.
