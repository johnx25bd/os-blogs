_Part 2 of A Programmer's Guide to Spatial Data_

In Part 1 of A Programmer's Guide to Spatial Data, we looked at how useful maps can be and introduced the concept of spatial data, which is any data that contains information about **where observations are**. We also introduced the two main ways of representing spatial data: a **raster dataset** is a regularly-spaced grid of cells or pixels with assigned values, and and **vector dataset** as coordinate pairs or sequences of coordinate pairs representing points, lines and polygons. 

Part 2 will dive deeper into the fundamental concepts that underpin location data, key ideas to understand to approach a spatial data analysis or visualisation task. We'll look at how some of the nuances of  coordinates and coordinate reference systems, projections, and we'll dig a bit deeper into raster and vector data. 

## Where Am I?

Accurately working out where we are on the Earth was one of the most difficult problems humans faced for millennia. Knowing where we are is the first step to deciding where we are going. For travellers - and especially mariners, who often had no fixed points of reference to orient themselves by other than the stars - the task of locating one's self was often a matter of life and death.

_[Dutch Boats in a Gale](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-dutch-boats-in-a-gale-the-bridgewater-sea-piece), by J.M.W. Turner, 1801, oil on canvas._

The Earth is round, but it is not a perfect sphere. It is a bit squashed - a shape called an "ellipsoid" - and it's lumpy, with mountains and valleys and sea mounts and so on, with different areas having different densities - more accurately, a "geoid". The planet rotates on its vertical axis. 

Imagine a line running through the diameter of a sphere along its vertical axis, connected by a line encircling the circumference of the sphere (called a meridian). From the center point of this diameter line, we can specify any _latitude_ - any position north or south of the equator on the sphere's surface. Latitude is represented as an angle, from 0¬∞ - a horizontal line from the sphere's center to the equator - to 90¬∞, a vertical line to the north or south pole.

As it turns out, latitude is _relatively_ easy to calculate by measuring the position of the sun at noon or the North Star or the Southern Cross above the horizon and doing some trigonometry, adjusting for the time of year. 

Longitude, on the other hand, is quite a bit trickier. This is because there is no "East pole" or "West pole". Instead, we have decided to use one of the meridians as the origin, reference meridian - the "Prime meridian", running through Greenwich, UK and the outskirts of Accra, Ghana, dividing the Eastern and Western hemispheres. 

Again, longitude is described in degrees from the radius running from the Prime meridian to the center of the Earth. As we move east, degrees increase up to 180¬∞, and as we move west, degrees decrease to -180¬∞, until they meet at the antimeridian - the other boundary between the Eastern and Western hemispheres in the Pacific Ocean.

_Latitude and longitude, from [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/latitude#/media/1/331993/109269)._


Finding longitude requires the navigator to calculate the time difference between their position and a known position - often the Prime Meridian. As the Earth rotates 360¬∞ every 24 hours, by working out this time difference, it is easy to compute how far east or west of the reference point someone is: 360¬∞ / 24 hrs = 15¬∞ per hour. It takes 4 minutes for the Earth to rotate 1¬∞. Reliably keeping time on a moving ship is a tricky thing, explaining the long, interesting history of the quest to build an accurate clock. For more on the history of longitude and John Harrison's efforts to design this clock, we recommend [Longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)) by Dava Sobel.

With longitude and latitude - the `x` and `y` coordinates - we can describe any point on the Earth's surface. (‚ö†Ô∏è: Note how this differs from the linguistic convention - "latitude and longitude". This is a constant bugbear for developers. There is no agreed-upon standard, so different programming tools represent coordinates inconsistently - some as `[x,y]` vs `[y,x]`. If your coordinates aren't showing up, or are in the wrong part of the world - first thing is to check the coordinate ordering! More on this [here](https://macwright.com/lonlat/), including which formats, JS APIs and services use which order, from Tom MacWright. 

**Representing coordinates**

Right - we've established that we can describe any position on the surface of a sphere as a pair of coordinates that represent the angle a line transecting that position from the origin, which is a radius drawn to the intersection of the equator and the Prime Meridian.

| Type | Example | 
| --- | --- |
| Decimal degrees | `[1.2314, 44.1243]` |
| Degrees, minutes, seconds | 1¬∞ xxx | 
| Radians | x |
| ?? | ?? |

### Coordinates
- coordinate formats: decimal degrees, deg min sec, radians, etc.
- Locating points on the surface of a sphere.
- Is this getting too in depth? Could be its own post. Don't want to lose people here.

#### Coordinate Reference Systems
- Geographic Reference Systems
- What it is and why it matters
- CRSs vs Projections
- üëç - use Web Mercator. Or BNG? (I'd like this to be applicable to a global audience).

#### Projections

### Representing Spatial Data

- Grids of regular pixels, each pixel assigned numerical values.
