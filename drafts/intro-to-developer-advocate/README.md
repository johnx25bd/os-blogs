# Introducing OS's new Developer Advocate

Hi all üëã - I'm John Hoopes, OS's new Developer Advocate. My job is to serve as a bridge between Ordnance Survey and the UK's developer community. I am here to help the community learn about the datasets OS is making available, and to help OS better understand the needs of the amazing community of developers, data scientists and analysts using OS data. 

## The OS Developer Advocate

With the signing of the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement, Ordnance Survey is undergoing a major shift in the data it has on offer, and how that data is delivered to the user. Notably, several OS data products including the OS MasterMap Topography layer, Open ZoomStack, ... now can be accessed via RESTful APIs. 

This is a strategic decision meant to make these datasets available to a new market of users, and to ease the burden on existing users. The cost and complexity of accessing premium data is also greatly reduced. The reason is simple: the UK government wants to make sure that the full economic value is unlocked from the information OS collects about Great Britain. 

What does this mean for you? If you're an existing OS data user, it means that you'll likely be accessing OS data in new ways, and that ...

## A bit about me

I've been working with location data in one form or another for over a decade - and if you count my youth poring over maps and exploring the mountains and coastlines of America, much longer. A windscreen tour:

**1987 - 2006:** Grew up in America - ski patroller, Eagle Scout, lots of hiking and adventuring, especially in my native Colorado.

**2006 - 2010:** BSc Biology and Environmental Studies at Tufts University in 2010, including courses in GIS and Remote Sensing

**2010 - 2012:** My first tech startup experience as co-founder at Junctions, building a location-based social graph. A failure - and a great learning experience.

**2012 - 2015:** Three years exploring the world as a travel journalist, guide, alpine patroller, cycle tourist and sailor. Didn't spend more than 10 nights in the same bed.

**2015 - 2016:** Odd jobs with SMEs in Denver including as a project manager for a proptech startup, an events coordinator for a co-working community space and a shop assistant at a sailing school. Started poking around with Python.

**2016 - 2018:** Worked in research at an international NGO studying maritime security. Location analytics with shipping data and visualization design for governments, militaries and the private sector. Dove headfirst into JavaScript - especially D3 üòç.

**2018 - 2019:** Attended UCL to study for an MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation at the Bartlett's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. Wrote my dissertation on decentralized and privacy-preserving location data governance, consensus networks and trusted IoT. Technical Director at London Blockchain Labs. 

**Now:** Was granted a Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa and joined OS as Developer Advocate.
